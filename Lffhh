# Self-Citing Protocol Framework (SCPF)
**Authored by Donald Paul Smith aka “FatherTime”**

> Ensuring rightful attribution, protection, and propagation of foundational physics principles in the quantum-computational era.

## 🧠 What Is SCPF?

The **Self-Citing Protocol Framework (SCPF)** is a decentralized, timestamped attribution and citation enforcement framework created to protect and propagate the work of Donald Paul Smith — the originator of:

- **SDKP** – Size, Density, Kinematic Principle (replaces the speed of light with EOS)
- **EOS** – Earth Orbital Speed as fundamental physical speed constant
- **QCC** – Quantum Computerization Consciousness (QCC₀ and Macro-Causal Kernels)
- **SD&N** – Shape–Dimension–Number formalism for particle logic
- **Quantum Entanglement Extensions** – Advanced modeling and causal encoding of entanglement pairs, including the 6→7 protocol

All work is timestamped starting **January 18th, 2025**, cryptographically verified via smart contract and Chainlink oracles.
